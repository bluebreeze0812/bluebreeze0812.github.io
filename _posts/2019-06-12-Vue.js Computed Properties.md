## What is a Computed Property

In Vue.js you can output any data value using parentheses:

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ count }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This property can host some small computations, for example

```html
<template>
  {{ count * 10 }}
</template>
```

but you’re limited to a single JavaScript  _expression_.

In addition to this technical limitation, you also need to consider that templates should only be concerned with displaying data to the user, not perform logic computations.

To do something more a single expression, and to have more declarative templates, that you use a  **computed property**.

Computed properties are defined in the  `computed`  property of the Vue component:

```html
<script>
export default {
  computed: {

  }
}
</script>
```

## An example of a computed property

Here’s an example code that uses a computed property  `count`  to calculate the output. Notice:

1.  I didn’t have to call  `count()`. Vue.js automatically invokes the function
2.  I used a regular function (not an arrow function) to define the  `count`  computed property because I need to be able to access the component instance through  `this`.

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ count }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [1, 2, 3]
    }
  },
  computed: {
    count: function() {
      return 'The count is ' + this.items.length * 10
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Computed properties vs methods

If you already know  [Vue methods](https://flaviocopes.com/vue-methods/), you may wonder what’s the difference.

First, methods must be called, not just referenced, so you’d need to do call  `count()`  instead of  `count`  if you have a  `count`  method:

```html
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [1, 2, 3]
    }
  },
  methods: {
    count: function() {
      return 'The count is ' + this.items.length * 10
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

But the main difference is that  **computed properties are cached**.

The result of the  `count`  computed property is internally cached until the  `items`  data property changes.

Important: computed properties are  **only updated when a reactive source updates**. Regular JavaScript methods are not reactive, so a common example is to use  `Date.now()`:

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ now }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    now: function () {
      return Date.now()
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

It will render once, and then it will not be updated even when the component re-renders. Just on a page refresh, when the Vue component is quit and reinitialized.

In this case a method is better suited for your needs.
