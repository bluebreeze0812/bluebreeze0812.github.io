The first time you try to install a package globally using  [npm](https://flaviocopes.com/npm/), using the syntax  `npm install -g <package>`  on a Mac, or Linux, you might get a weird error, saying something like

```txt
Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

or something along those lines, followed by a long list of other errors of warnings, a consequence of the first error that’s printed to you.

This error is preventing us to install the package.

How do you fix this? It’s a permission error, which means you don’t have write access to that folder.

This is how to solve it. Run this command:

```sh
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

Let’s break it down:

`sudo`  means we are running this command as  `root`, the system super user. This is because we don’t have permission to write to that folder, but  `root`  will be able to fix any permission. This command also means the system will ask for your password to confirm.

`chown`  is the command we use to change the owner of a file or folder. We set the  `-R`  option to change the owner recursively, so we also get owner access to all the files already contained in there.

`$USER`  is an environment variable automatically set to your username.

And the final piece is the folder path.

Running this path will make the folder  _yours_, so you can safely run your  `npm install -g <package>`  commands!

Pay attention to the folder listed by the error message. If it’s different, update the  `chown`command accordingly.
