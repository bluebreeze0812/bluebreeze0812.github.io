This is indicates [AntPathMatcher](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.html)

The mapping matches URLs using the following rules:

    ? matches one character
    * matches zero or more characters
    ** matches zero or more 'directories' in a path

Some examples:

    com/t?st.jsp - matches com/test.jsp but also com/tast.jsp or com/txst.jsp
    com/*.jsp - matches all .jsp files in the com directory
    com/**/test.jsp - matches all test.jsp files underneath the com path
    org/springframework/**/*.jsp - matches all .jsp files underneath the org/springframework path
    org/**/servlet/bla.jsp - matches org/springframework/servlet/bla.jsp but also org/springframework/testing/servlet/bla.jsp and org/servlet/bla.jsp
